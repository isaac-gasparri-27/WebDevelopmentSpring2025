        William Blake <mark>(28 November 1757 - 12 August 1827)</mark> was an English poet, painter, and
    printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in
    the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic
    works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion to its
    merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".<sub>[2]</sub> His visual artistry led 21st-
    century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him <q>far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever
    produced</q>.<sup>[3]</sup> In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest
    Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,
    <cite>[5]</cite> he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the
    imagination as <strong>"the body of God"[6]</strong> or <b>"human existence itself".[7]</b>

        <em>Although Blake</em> was <i>considered mad</i> by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held
    in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical
    and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised
    as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has been said to be
    <blockquote>"a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9]</blockquote> A committed Christian who
    was hostile to the <abbr title="Church of England">Church of EN</abbr> (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion),
    Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions.
    [10][11] Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable
    relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such
    as Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] <bdo dir="rtl"> these known influences,</bdo> the singularity of Blake's work
    makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti
    characterised him as a "glorious luminary".[13] and "a man not forestalled by predecessors,
