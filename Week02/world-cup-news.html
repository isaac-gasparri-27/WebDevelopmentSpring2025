            On a player's turn, they can either take an <strong>income turn</strong> or an 
            <strong>advancement turn</strong>. An income turn denotes the start of a new era. 
            Players will <em>first</em> use their civilization's ability if applicable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Second,</em> they will play a tapestry card onto their income mat. 
            Tapestry cards provide either an immediate benefit or a benefit which 
            contains throughout the era. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Third,</em> they may upgrade a technology card. Technology cards have a 'circle'
            and a 'square' benefit. Rows for tech cards are shown on the right of a 
            player's capital city mat. When a player gains a tech card, it is placed in 
            the bottom 'cross' row. Whenever it is upgraded, it moves up to a higher row
            and the player gains the benefit listed on the tech card for that row. Next,
            they gain victory points for exposed victory point icons on their income
            tracks. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            <em>Finally,</em> they gain resources for exposed resource icons on their income 
            tracks, as well as a tapestry card and a territory tile.
