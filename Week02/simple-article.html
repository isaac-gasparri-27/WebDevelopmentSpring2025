            On a sunny afternoon, a careless tabby cat lounged lazily on the soft cushions of the couch, completely at ease. Sunlight streamed through the window, warming its fur as it stretched out, one paw dangling off the edge. Purring softly, the cat blinked slowly, its green eyes half-closed in bliss. A gentle breeze from the open window rustled the curtains, but nothing disturbed the feline's serene daydream. Truly, this was the life of pure, unbothered luxury.

            The tabby rolled onto its back, belly exposed, as if daring the world to disturb its peace. A single ray of sunshine highlighted its whiskers, and with a lazy yawn, it dozed off again. Nothing could ruin this perfect napâ€”except maybe the sound of the treat jar.
